    <h2>Why I got into Chess</h2>
    <br>
    <p> I began playing chess around 5-6 years old when I played my grandfather for the very first time ever. He had scholars mated me a couple of times as I had no idea how to play at the time but that was where my love for chess had started.</p>
    <br>
    <p>He still to this day has refused to play me however my passion for chess has not waivered and I am still persuing my dreams in the chess world.</p>
