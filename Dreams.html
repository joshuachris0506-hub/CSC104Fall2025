    <h2>My Chess Career Goals</h2>
    <br>
    <p> My chess goals are to become a titled player, specifically a FM rated player so that I may become a chess teacher and teach people all around the world chess. I never had any goal to be the best but I want people to experience chess and have fun with the game the same way I did growing up.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Getting to this goal will take time, but time I am willing to spend to achieve my dream job of being a chess teacher.</p>
